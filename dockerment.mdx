# CS 1230 Docker Grading Environment Student Guide 

This document explains how we the TA staff grade your assignments. We use (if all else fails) a class Docker image to compile, build, and run your code. The following sections will go over how we use this Docker image so that you can ensure we see the same output you do.  

## Docker Overview 

From the Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/): 
```
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. 
```

For the purposes of this class, you can think of Docker as a virtual machine that contains a standardized build environment. Checking that your code builds and runs in this build environment will ensure that we can build and run your code as well. This alleviates the problem in previous years where TAs were sometimes unable to run student code. 

### Terminology 
**Docker Image** - A Docker image is a read-only template for creating a Docker container. An image is only the instructions for how to setup the environment. What is actually being run is a Docker container. 

**Docker Container** - A Docker container is a **mostly** isolated environment to build and run applications 

## Gradescope 

If you **only** want to check that your project compiles, each class assignment has an autograder setup that only checks if the successfully successfully compiles. This requires no local setup on your end!

## Running Docker Locally 

If you really want to ensure that we are seeing the same output that you're seeing, you will need to setup docker locally. 

Get docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Pull the unified class grading environment with `docker pull anc2001/cs1230_env:latest`
